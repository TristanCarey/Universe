The Dragon Dentist was super interesting imo ! Been a while I haven't been at the dentist ... Anyway, follow the animu you saw with 'Universe' !

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff. To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

What do 'Universe' change ? 
-------------------------------

 I found the original design quite boring to be honest with you and not really modern contrary to others like Anilist and such, that's why I wanted to give it a fresh and minimalist style :
- in general : if you are currently using some styles I created, you'll notice that there is a fucking banner this time too, you'll be able to change it by searching all the "i.imgur.com/kespRVb.jpg" in the script and replacing it by whatever you want. I put the logo, navigation menu, searchbar, notifications, profile and such all together in a fixed headbar (ie it'll scroll with the page). Changed the icons and logo of MAL, moreover I put the japanese equivalent of each section title because why not, it gives a aesthetic vibe (btw, I used an online dictionnary, so if there is a word that doesn't make any sense it's normal !). There were some person that said they don't really like the omnipresence of black, so if you want me to change the color scheme just tell me in the comments since my script is a mess and I'm sure you'll be lost... Also the footer is still here, because I don't mind it being here !
- for the profile section : I wanted it to be more appealing for the eyes since it's the first page you see, I made the font bigger, underlined the title by putting them into blue boxes, redesign a bit the rank boxes, etc. Btw, I didn't change every widget since I only use a few, so if there is one that stands out it's normal, just ask me to change it and I'll do it asap.
- for the anime/manga information section : one of the section I'm the most proud of actually, even tho I didn't really change the layout, I did remove some useless stuff, I change the position of the navigation bar and put it under the banner (I did it for most of the section).
- for the news sections and others : more or less the same comment as above, a simple and minimalist design, maybe there are a bit too much of 'boxes' but I love them !  

How to install it ?
-------------------------------
After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style', copy/paste the code in 'universe.css', name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

* to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/rob…), 'Bebas Neue' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/beb…), 'Bokutachi no Gothic 2' (www.freejapanesefont.com/bokut…) and if you want Meiryo, all of them are free so don't be shy.
* download Adblock Plus to kill the ads.

NB : writing a MAL script is really a pain since there are a lot of section to change, that's why there are still some section unchanged (for example the 'users' section) and some minor stuff need to be change, if it really bothers you just post a comment about it and I'll see what I can do.

Where can I find your works ?
-------------------------------
I have a deviantart page : nicknameisfortheweak.deviantart.com
I also submit my script in pastebin : http://pastebin.com/u/Catgrills

And that's it, I hope you'll enjoy this script if you see this submission ! Like usual, if you have find the script cool or bad, if you have questions, suggestions, there is a section called 'Comments', you can use it everytime !
